          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hewo everynyan. I am Chuck, also known as Adri. I am a college
            student studying Computer Science even though I have no particular
            interest in coding. I am, however, very passionate when it comes to
            tech. My interest in tech first ignited when I got my first tablet,
            the iPad 2. I loved to mess around with it like offloading IPA files
            and managing app files through iFunbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            It then continued when I first discovered Linus from Linus Tech
            Tips. His videos were not only educational but also entertainingly
            hacky and geeky. I learned so many tech tips and tricks from his
            channels which got me very interested in computing, both software
            and hardware.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to him, I became very confident in fixing my own gadgets. I
            have disasembled many laptops, not only the one I had but also my
            friends' who were in need of fixing or upgrading. I also used to
            disassemble phones when removable back cover was still a thing. Once
            I helped one of my friend in changing his own phone battery. I did
            not charge him anything and would never do to any of my friends,
            heck I would encourage them to let me help them with gadget repairs.

          <p>
            As I have mentioned before, I love watching tech YouTubers like
            Linus Tech Tips. Other than LTT, I also watch JayzTwoCents, Austin
            Evans, Dave2D, Mrwhosetheboss, MKBHD, and some Indonesian tech
            YouTubers such as JagatReview.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also love cooking, especially with meat. I am always eager to
            experiment with different cooking styles. My latest successful
            experiment was burito-like vietnamesse spring role with saikoro and
            omelette fillings. It's both juicy and creamy and also very simple.

            I often post unique stuffs cool info on Instagram, especially those
            piqued my interest. They can be tech memes, cool tricks I found and
            implemented. If you want to contact me, however, please do so
            through my Discord as I should be able to respond quicker. I also
            have a YouTube channel, _chuck1z. There I post useful stuffs that
            people might look up, currently they're Minecraft-related though.
